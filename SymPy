🧮 What is SymPy?
SymPy stands for Symbolic Python.

It is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics, similar to how you solve math problems on paper (as opposed to numerical computation like NumPy).

Used for algebra, calculus, equations, matrices, discrete math, and more.

📦 1. Key Features of SymPy
Symbolic computation (e.g., keeps variables like x, y, instead of assigning numbers)

Written entirely in Python (no external dependencies)

Supports algebraic simplification, differentiation, integration, solving equations, series, matrices, and discrete math

Generates LaTeX, code (C, Python, Fortran), and pretty printed math output

🔣 2. Core Concepts
a. Symbols
The foundation of symbolic computation in SymPy.
from sympy import symbols
x, y = symbols('x y')
b. Expressions
You can build algebraic expressions using symbols.
expr = x**2 + 2*x + 1
c. Simplification
Reduce expressions to simpler form.
from sympy import simplify
simplify((x**2 + 2*x + 1)/(x + 1))
d. Substitution
Replace symbols with values or other expressions.
expr.subs(x, 2)  # Replaces x with 2
🧮 3. Algebraic Operations
Operation	Description	Example
expand()	Expand products	(x + 1)**2 → x² + 2x + 1
factor()	Factor expressions	x² + 2x + 1 → (x + 1)**2
collect()	Collect like terms	x*y + x*z → x*(y + z)
together()	Combine fractions	

∫ 4. Calculus Operations
a. Differentiation
from sympy import diff
diff(x**3 + x, x)  # Output: 3x² + 1
b. Integration
from sympy import integrate
integrate(x**2, x)  # Output: x³/3
c. Limits
from sympy import limit
limit((x**2 - 1)/(x - 1), x, 1)  # Output: 2
d. Series Expansion
from sympy import series
series(sin(x), x, 0, 5)
🧩 5. Equation Solving
a. Algebraic Equations
from sympy import Eq, solve
eq1 = Eq(x**2 - 4, 0)
solve(eq1, x)  # Output: [-2, 2]
b. Systems of Equations
from sympy import solve
solve([x + y - 3, x - y - 1], (x, y))
📐 6. Matrices
Symbolic matrices and linear algebra:
from sympy import Matrix
A = Matrix([[1, x], [x, 1]])
A.det()  # Determinant
A.inv()  # Inverse (if it exists)
📏 7. Discrete Mathematics
Combinatorics: permutations, combinations, partitions.

Number Theory: gcd, lcm, primes, modular arithmetic.

Logic: Boolean algebra, truth tables.

🖋️ 8. LaTeX & Pretty Printing
a. Pretty Output
from sympy import init_printinginit_printing()
b. LaTeX Export
from sympy import latex
latex(expr)  # Converts expression to LaTeX string
⚙️ 9. Code Generation
Generate C, Python, or Fortran code from symbolic expressions:
