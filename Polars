Polars Library (Theory Explanation)
What is Polars?
Polars is a fast and modern DataFrame library designed for data analysis, similar to Pandas, but much faster and more memory-efficient.
It’s written in Rust (a systems programming language), but provides a Python API.

Think of Polars as:

🏎 Pandas on steroids — built for speed and handling big data smoothly.

Why Polars? (Advantages)
Speed: Much faster than Pandas, especially on big datasets.

Memory Efficient: Uses less RAM.

Multithreading: Uses multiple CPU cores automatically.

Lazy Evaluation: Only computes results when needed (like Spark).

Arrow-based: Uses Apache Arrow memory format, which is modern and efficient.

Key Features
Feature	Polars Explanation
DataFrames	Just like Pandas — tables with rows and columns.
Lazy & Eager Mode	Lazy: waits to execute, Eager: runs immediately.
Parallel Processing	Uses multiple CPU cores automatically.
Arrow Backend	Fast, columnar data format 
Polars Modes
Eager Mode: Works like Pandas. You write code → it runs → gives result.

Lazy Mode: You build queries → Polars optimizes → runs everything at once (more efficient for big data).
