TYPES OF MACHINE  LEARNING                                                                                                                                                                                                🔵 1. Supervised Learning
Definition: The model learns from labeled data (input and corresponding output).

Goal: Predict output from new inputs based on learned relationships.

Examples:

Email Spam Detection

House Price Prediction

Loan Approval

Algorithms:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Sub-types:

Regression: Predict continuous values (e.g., price, salary)

Classification: Predict categories (e.g., spam/ham, disease/no disease)

🟡 2. Unsupervised Learning
Definition: The model works with unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns or structures.

Goal: Discover underlying structure in data without predefined labels.

Examples:

Customer Segmentation

Market Basket Analysis

Anomaly Detection

Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

DBSCAN

🔴 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition: Uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

Goal: Improve learning accuracy when labeled data is scarce.

Examples:

Medical Diagnosis (few labeled patient reports)

Web Page Classification

Techniques:

Self-training

Co-training

Graph-based methods

🟢 4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Definition: The model learns through trial and error to maximize a reward.

Goal: Learn a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment.

Key Concepts:

Agent: Learner/decision-maker

Environment: What the agent interacts with

Reward: Feedback signal for actions

Examples:

Game Playing (e.g., AlphaGo, Chess)

Robotics

Autonomous Vehicles

Algorithms:

Q-Learning

Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

Policy Gradient Methods

🔘 5. Self-Supervised Learning (emerging type)
Definition: A form of supervised learning where the labels are generated from the data itself.

Goal: Pre-train models using large unlabeled datasets.

Examples:

Natural Language Processing (e.g., BERT, GPT)

Image recognition pre-training

Common in: Deep Learning, especially in NLP and Vision.
