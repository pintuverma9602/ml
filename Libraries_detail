✅ What is a Library in Python?
A library in Python is a collection of pre-written code that you can reuse in your own programs.
Instead of writing everything from scratch, you just import a library and use its functions or classes.

Think of a library like a toolbox. If you're building something (a project), you open the toolbox (import the library) and use the tools (functions) inside.

🔰 Why Use Libraries?
Save time

Avoid writing complex code yourself

Reuse tested and optimized functions

Make your code shorter and cleaner

Help with specific tasks like data analysis, machine learning, web dev, etc.

🧩 Types of Libraries in Python (Based on Use)
Here are the main types of libraries:

🔹 1. Standard Libraries (Built-in)
These come pre-installed with Python.

Examples:


Library	Use
math	Math operations
datetime	Work with dates/times
os	Operating system interaction
sys	System-specific parameters
random	Generate random numbers
✅ You don’t need to install these. Just use import.

🔹 2. External Libraries (Third-party)
These are not included in Python by default.
You need to install them using pip (Python package manager).

Examples:


Library	Use
pandas	Data analysis
matplotlib	Data visualization
scikit-learn	Machine learning
Flask	Web development
TensorFlow	Deep learning
🧠 Install with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install library-name
🔹 3. Custom/User-defined Libraries
You can also create your own library by writing functions in a .py file and importing it into other programs.
