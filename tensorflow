📘 TensorFlow Theory 
🔹 1. What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is an open-source end-to-end machine learning and deep learning framework developed by Google Brain Team. It allows developers to build and deploy ML models easily.

Supports both CPU and GPU

Runs on desktop, server, mobile, and edge devices

Ideal for numerical computation using data flow graphs

🔹 2. Why is it called TensorFlow?
Tensor = multi-dimensional array (like matrix)

Flow = computation as a graph of operations (data "flows" through the graph)

So, TensorFlow = flow of tensors through a graph of operations.

🔹 3. Core Components
Component	Description
Tensor	N-dimensional array (data)
Graph	A set of operations organized into a computational graph
Session (TF 1.x)	Used to execute a graph
Eager Execution (TF 2.x)	Runs operations immediately (more intuitive)
Keras API	High-level API to build and train models easily
Layers	Pre-built layers for deep learning (Dense, Conv2D, etc.)

🔹 4. How TensorFlow Works (Simplified Flow)
Build a computational graph

Run the graph using a session (in TF 1.x) or immediately (in TF 2.x with Eager Execution)

Train the model using gradient descent or other optimizers

Evaluate and deploy the model

🔹 5. Tensors in TensorFlow
Rank 0: Scalar (e.g., 5)

Rank 1: Vector (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

Rank 2: Matrix (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]])

Higher Ranks: N-dimensional arrays

TensorFlow handles complex tensor operations efficiently.

🔹 6. High-Level API: tf.keras
tf.keras is a high-level deep learning API within TensorFlow. It provides:

Sequential and functional model definitions

Preprocessing layers

Built-in training loops: model.fit(), model.evaluate(), model.predict()

🔹 7. Common Use Cases
Neural Networks (ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM)

Image Recognition

Text Classification

Time-Series Forecasting

Reinforcement Learning

Speech Recognition

🔹 8. TensorFlow Ecosystem
Tool	Purpose
TensorBoard	Visualization tool for training metrics
TFLite	Deploy models on mobile and embedded devices
TFHub	Pretrained models sharing
TFX	Production pipeline for ML
TensorFlow.js	Run TF in the browser with JavaScript
TensorFlow Extended (TFX)	Scalable ML pipelines

🔹 9. Advantages
Scalable (runs on GPUs, TPUs)

Production-ready (TF Serving, TFX)

Large community and support

Integrates with Keras for simplicity
